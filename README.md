# cyclegan-learning
My first attempt to implement a CycleGAN in TensorFlow based on Jun-Yan Zhu, Taesung Park, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A. Efros. "Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks", in IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017.  See: https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/
